<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage Examples


#### Face Detection (Real-Time Parametric)

<img src="Examples/FaceDetectionEX.jpg" alt="Logo" width="450" height="450">
SIPL Offers A Real-Time face detection algorithm which is parametric ,meaning theres is no machine learning involved in this spesific algorithm ,it tries to detect a face by color difference stated by the user. The success rate of the algorithm depends on the parameters passed to the function and they are individual for each image!.

#### Image Color Segmentation 

<img src="Examples/Kmeans 2-16.jpeg" alt="Logo" width="750" height="250">
SIPL Offers A Quick Algorithm For Image Color Segmentation Using K Means, useful for color variance reduction
